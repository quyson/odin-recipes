In this project, I've learned and applied basic HTML concepts such as creating the boiler plate as well as utilizing headings, unordered and ordered lists, paragraphs,, and images. This project also has helped me learn more about Git and it's workflow in a practical application. Ultimately, by incorporating all of these concepts, I was able to create a functional website in which I detailed varying recipes and the ingredients and steps needed to make them.
Most recently, I've applied basic CSS concepts into this project allowing this website to have a bit more color and a more complex design than just everything being positioned towards the left. The CSS concepts that I applied involved coloring, text alignment, centering through margins, and padding.
