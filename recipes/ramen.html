    <h3>What is Ramen?</h3>
    <p>Ramen is a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles (or 中華麺, chūkamen) served in a broth; common flavors are 
        soy sauce and miso, with typical toppings including sliced pork (chāshū), nori (dried seaweed), menma (bamboo shoots), and scallions. Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle dishes. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido.</p>
    <p> Ichiraku Ramen is a popular ramen shop in the Naruto Universe. Although it is quite small and has an unassuming appearance, Ramen Ichiraku has always been popular with Konoha's villagers because of Teuchi's (the owner) strong commitment to taste, giving the ramen an almost artistic quality. Like any ramen establishment, Ramen Ichiraku offers various toppings, such as char siu and boiled eggs. </p>
