    <h3 class="heading2">What is a Krabby Patty?</h3>
    <p>The Krabby Patty is the Krusty Krab's signature food item. It is a meatless hamburger of sorts made from seaweed-sea buns, undersea vegetables, condiments, and a patty; it can also be ordered with cheese. The ingredients of the patty itself are purposely kept secret throughout the entire series.
        The Krabby Patty is known for being extremely unhealthy and fattening. Squidward refers to it as "a heart attack on a bun" in "Just One Bite." They can also have a dangerous and unfortunate side effect. When way too many Krabby Patties are eaten at one time, the consumer will become obese in the
         thigh area and explode. This happens to Squidward in the aforementioned "Just One Bite," when he breaks into the patty vault and eats too many Krabby Patties at once.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Do not eat more than one at a time. You will choke and possbily die.</em></strong></p>
    <h3 class="heading2">Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sea Cheese</li>
        <li>Patty</li>

    </ul>
    <h3 class="heading2">Steps:</h3>
    <p><em>Spongebob is a mandatory requirement for making a quality Krabby Patty. Expect your burger
        to be much worse if you are missing the "Spongebob" ingredient! If you are missing the Secret Sauce, tartar sauce is an okay substitute.
