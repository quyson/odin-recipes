    <h3 class="heading2">What is meat?</h3>
    <p>Meat, in its broadest definition, consists of animal fleshâ€”whether raw or cooked. It is commonly harvested from domesticated mammals 
        (e.g. cattle, pigs, sheep) or birds (e.g. chickens, turkeys), but may also be taken from wild animals, including reptiles and amphibians.
        Meat has been Monkey D. Luffy's favorite food since childhood. When Luffy is either tired or exhausted, he is able to consume meat in order to promote faster regeneration to recover from exhaustion, and thanks to his rubber metabolism, he is able to 
        recover from even the largest of meals, being full of energy and ready to fight in no time.
